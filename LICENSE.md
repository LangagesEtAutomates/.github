## Acknowledgments and Sources

Some teaching material in this organization (e.g. exercises, or code snippets) is **inspired by or adapted from** external sources such as in textbooks or research articles on formal languages.  
All statements have been **translated, rewritten, or contextualized** for educational use, without verbatim reproduction of any protected material.  
When a specific source is closely followed, it is **explicitly acknowledged** in the file header or in a footnote within the derived pdf material.

Some exercises in the introductory sessions (notably those involving the Levi lemma, equidivisibility, and the Fibonacci palindrome construction)
were inspired by earlier problem sets designed by former instructors of the course at Nantes Université, including
Denis Béchet, Emmanuel Desmontils and Chantal Enguehard. All statements, notations, and solutions have been fully rewritten and do not reproduce any copyrighted material from prior problem sets.
